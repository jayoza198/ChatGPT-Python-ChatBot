# ChatGPT-Python-ChatBot

This is a Python-based chatbot using the OpenAI API to generate responses. The project contains two methods to call the OpenAI API: using the OpenAI Python package and using the API endpoint.


## Method 1: Using OpenAI Python Package

The OpenAI Python package provides a convenient interface to access the OpenAI API. This method involves installing the package, setting up authentication, and calling the appropriate functions to generate responses.

## Method 2: Using API Endpoint

Alternatively, you can call the OpenAI API directly using the API endpoint. This method involves sending an HTTP request to the API endpoint with the appropriate parameters.
